# SamiHotel — DDD, CQRS & Clean Architecture Practice 🏨

This repository contains a **partial & experimental hotel management system** project created to learn and explore **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**, and **Clean Architecture** principles in a real-world-like codebase.

> 📌 This is an **educational and practice project**, not a production-ready system.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

- Learn **Clean Architecture** structure with separate layers
- Implement **DDD patterns** such as Entities, Aggregates, Value Objects, etc.
- Practice **CQRS** (separating reads and writes)
- Understand how architectural boundaries help maintainability
- Get hands-on experience building multi-layer server applications

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This project is built using a layered structure typically seen in Clean Architecture:

- **Domain** — Core business logic and domain models  
- **Application** — Use cases, commands & query handlers  
- **Infrastructure** — Data access, persistence, external dependencies  
- **WebAppHotel / WebAppReserve / WedMvcAdmin** — User interface layers

This separation helps you see how responsibilities are organized in larger backend applications.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **C# & .NET**  
- Clean Architecture pattern  
- DDD concepts (Domain layer separation)  
- CQRS (Command & Query segregation)  
- Web APIs and UI apps (MVC)

## 🛠 How to Use

You can clone and open the project in your IDE (Visual Studio / VS Code / Rider) to explore and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmadnia13116/SamiHotel.git
cd SamiHotel
